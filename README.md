# nigerian_states_api
-------------------------
Django Rest Framework API
-------------------------

An API with only one endpoint that allows only a POST request
Input a json body with field name_of_state and it returns a response showing the name of the current governor and deputy governor.
Like so: ``{ "name_of_state": "edo"}``
Thanks.
